<h1>The Rest Came Down From Here</h1>
<p>Marching down to their boats on the shore<br>
He climbed to the tower of the church <img src="img/bird.jpg" ALIGN=”right” /> <br>
Up the wooden stairs,<br>
with ...<br>
You know the rest.</p>

<p>
There are things you can replace,<br> 
and others you cannot.<br>
The time ...<br> 
Now my only trouble,<br> 
the rest<br> 
I forgot ...</p>

<p>Dressed myself in green,<br> 
I went down unto the sea.<br>
there are other eyes watching her coming<br> 
and other voices ready to take up ...<br>
We will rest up</p>

<p>"It should have come down"<br> 
or<br> 
"It should have came down ...<br>
coming after them is left to carry the rest
</p>
