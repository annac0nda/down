<h1>The Rest Came Down From Here</h1>
<p>Marching down to their boats on the shore
He climbed to the tower of the church
Up the wooden stairs, 
with ... 
You know the rest.</p>

<p>
There are things you can replace, 
and others you cannot.
The time ... 
Now my only trouble, 
the rest 
I forgot ...</p>

<p>Dressed myself in green, 
I went down unto the sea.
there are other eyes watching her coming 
and other voices ready to take up ...
We will rest up</p>

<p>"It should have come down" 
or 
"It should have came down ...
coming after them is left to carry the rest
</p>
